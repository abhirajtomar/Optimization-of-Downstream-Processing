Optimization-of-Downstream-Processing
=====================================
The project involved optimizing the downstream synthesis of human insulin in terms of the revenue generated 
and time required by the process. 
An in depth analyses of the biological process was done to determine the relationships between the variables involved. 
The algorithm incorporated the bounds on the various parameters in the multiple stages involved and 
the interdependencies between them and hence optimizing each stage, followed by interleaving the results of 
all stages to find the best possible combination of variables in a given range. 

The files are for an applet, optimizing the process as described above.
